A couple of weeks ago I started the Brainstation part-time online iOS bootcamp. That is a long, descriptive way of saying it's lead by a real instructor one night a week but is online and you do the homework/study in your time.

I wanted to take a few moments and catch up on the first two weeks of the bootcamp; making sure I got my thoughts down and impressions down.

First thing is I have not done a bootcamp before. I was doing the Treehouse Techdegree for a few months but was sidetracked and lost focus in that program. It's a great program, but I wanted something a bit more personal then the videos and I've been watching them for two years trying to keep up with all the materials. I had almost finished all the videos but was going through the projects to get that done when I had personal issues and stopped. I can hop back in at any time to keep going, and do plan on doing that as soon as I'm done with this bootcamp. 

With this I needed something with a more personal touch. I wanted an instructor. But I couldn't go to a bootcamp for 10 weeks and do 100% immersion into a program. My couldn't do that to my family. After doing a ton of research on cost vs program details I also noticed something interesting. A lot of iOS programs were being dropped. I couldn't find a good reason, but I'm guessing that the Swift language is evolving pretty quickly and it was hard to keep up with the changes for some companies so it's easier to just remove the program and focus on other programs.
