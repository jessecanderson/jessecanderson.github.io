I have listed on my timeline that I started learning Swift way back in 2014. You would think that after trying to work on it for 4 years now that I would be more proficient in Swift then I am today. I keep hitting roadblocks and getting knocked off the path that I started and having to start over. I spend months at a time not looking at code but working on things that matter to my real job. Things that keep the bills paid. So where does that leave me? Four years of training costs, fees, and other expenses on this journey that I haven't really used to the full potential and now I'm starting over again. This year, as I say for most years, will be my year.
