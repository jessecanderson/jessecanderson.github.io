Starting today, NetApp is hosting their storage conference in Las Vegas, NV. This has always been one of my favorite conventions and I'm so sad that I won't be able to attend it this year.

In years past, NetApp has always pushed the boundaries when it comes to the idea of a storage vendor. They are a company that focuses on their customers, and delver innovations around managing and migrating storage especially around cloud solutions.

When I first got involved with NetApp years ago, one of the first things someone said was that they were not a hardware company but a software company. I loved that idea, that the focus was on making great storage software to help their customers manage data wherever it happened to be. That was a very forward thinking position as the popularity of DevOps and cloud based solutions have grown over the last few years.

Two years ago, Insight blew me away with their focus on developers and DevOps. With the introduction of [The Pub]("https://netapp.io") and the developer cafe at Insight, they showed how they were supporting not just the infrastructure administrators but giving DevOps and developers the tools they needed to be successful with NetApp technologies.

I'm excited to see what they come out with this year, I will be watching closely and you can follow along on Twitter with my fellow A-Team members. Just look for the following twitter hashtags #NetAppATeam and #NetAppInsight.
