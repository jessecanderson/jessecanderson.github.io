I have been a Solution Architect at AWS for just at 10 months now and during that time I have pushed myself to learn two skills at the same time.

First, AWS. Coming from a more traditional background, learning AWS and how things are architected in the cloud was an amazing challenge. I'm no expert by any means, but I've learned SO much over the last few months on cloud, cloud compute, different design patterns, and always planing for failure. I've always tried to architect my infrastructure in a highly available way, but with cloud options, you can do highly available so much more efficiently then anything I was able to build traditional due to lack of resources and the high cost of trying to implement these technologies myself. AWS allows you to really rethink high available architecture without breaking a bank and scaling global in a matter of minutes instead of days or weeks or even months.

Second, Pre-sales solutions architect. I come from a post sales background. I've worked with customers before, I've done white boarding before, and I've architected things for customers before but always in a post sales environment. They would get sold some gear and I would have to install it and then we would architect around how to get it to work correctly. There was always some transfer of knowledge that would happen, and I would try and reach back out to help them if I could. Pre-sales SA is different, and wrapping your head around all 100+ services and wanting really badly to always have a correct answer to every little detail is very overwhelming. I think this is the part I have had the most trouble with. I can learn the technologies, and as I use them more or see them in use more often then I feel more comfortable talking about these technologies and presenting these topics to people.

So what happened and why do I say I'm broken?

We have an internal process here at AWS, and I think it's a great thing to have to go through. When I went through it, I was not as prepared as I thought I was and the stress of going through it scared me in a way that I have never been scared before. This has left an attachment in my head. Now, when I think about this process, or presenting in front of my peers, or presenting in front of my boss, I have increased anxiety that could/may/possibly turn into a full on panic attack. (I had that happen at a customer location and it was not pleasant)

Where from here? Am I leaving AWS? I sure hope not. I have a couple of options that I am pursuing in order to stay within the company. It's an amazing company, and the culture is amazing, I just need to step back and refocus myself and I can't do that in my role that is causing me so much issues. If I don't get one of the other options then I will step down from my position at AWS. I'm not a benefit to the team at all in my current state and I want them to be successful. If that happens, I'm just going to find something short term to do until I can get back on my feet. I've got options, and I'm not afraid to call in favors if I have to, for work as I look at where I am in my career and what I need in order to be successful in my field. I've started down the cloud journey, and I'm on that path for good.....unless I find an iOS job somewhere that is. :P 

This isn't a negative mark on AWS, or myself. This was just me not being prepared mentally for the pressure that I was under and it broke something in my head.
