I was recently listening to a podcast by [Developer Tea](https://spec.fm/podcasts/developer-tea) when he mentioned something called "impostor syndrome". I had to look it up and even though the Wikipedia didn't define it the way I had it in my mind, it is something that I have felt a lot in my career.

I'm going to define Impostor Syndrome as the following:
  - Feeling of inadequacy in your job even though you have worked very hard to learn the skills needed.

When I started out in IT, I managed Windows servers as a Jr. Admin for a company. Our group had a web based application that we would deploy to all our test, load test, and production servers. We used IBM WebSphere to handle our web packages and had a very manual process for deploying the proper files. After a few months of working this way, I sat down with one of our sr. engineers and we hashed out a whole bunch of batch scripts that automated our deployments. (I didn't know it at the time, but we work working the beginning of DevOps.)

From there, I decided to dive into networking and Cisco. This is where the feelings of impostor syndrome for me started to creep up. Here I was, the new guy from the WinTel group trying to sort out problems that the sr. people had been working on for a while. The feeling wasn't all that great at this point, I was still new enough in IT that even though I felt a little out of place I worked through that.

After working in the network field for a while I started making the switch to storage networking and storage. This was a company necessity for the company I was with at the time. Here, I did start feeling more like an impostor since I wasn't really a "storage guy" and getting in and telling storage people what was wrong with their SAN and storage appliances.

Over the last couple of years, I've really started putting a bunch of effort into learning to code. This started out with iOS and Swift code and expanded to add in DevOps based technologies and tools such as infrastructure as code platforms like Chef and Puppet. For me, this has been the worst feeling of impostor syndrome as I defined it above. I'm having an issue in really breaking into the area of calling myself a "developer" for either the infrastructure as code platforms or my iOS learning.
