2016 is coming to an end. I thought I would take a moment and reflect on the year that has past as we look forward to the future.

I think we can all agree, looking back on this year, that 2016 has been a hell of a year. There have been many ups and downs throughout the year that have impacted us all in both positive and negative ways. I'm not going to dwell on the negative, I'm sure we have done enough of that as it is, but I want to look at the positive and then just an overall look at how information and data have really pushed to the front of things over the last year more then previous years.

We have seen many different technological advances over the year. Some of my favorite being from NetApp as they continue to innovate and push their products farther. Their partnership with Amazon is a great example of this. Being able to run ONTAP in the AWS cloud is a creative and flexible way to manage your date in AWS as well as moving it onsite to cloud. Amazon's Snowball offering is another that really blew me away. I love the idea of kicking off a data transfer and then having a huge array just show up for you to seed that data. The automation and planning that goes into these types of offerings just blow my mind.

This has also been a great year for developers. DevOps has been a buzzword for a few years, but the ideas that this cultural change are pushing are really catching on fast and wonderful products and workflows are showing no sign of slowing down. Companies like Chef and Puppet are changing what it means to be in operations and working with developers to get a better understanding of how things really work helps us all in our after hours phone calls.

So many amazing things happened this year in tech it is hard to remember them all, I'm sure there are loads more with computers, mobile, cloud, and developer things that I won't list here.

One thing I did want to touch on was the impact of data on this year. Part of what has made this year the dumpster fire that it was would be the ease of how data is broadcast now. Our society is at a tipping point (or past that tipping point really?) of sharing data at an alarming rate. But the way data is consumed now has to be 140 characters or less and we don't validate that the data we read in these little snippets are 100% true and accurate. We see something that easily conforms to our world view and take that as hard fact because it was on the internet. Someone put it up there, they must have done the research themselves an it should be true. Opinion pieces are posted without any validate, and shared millions of times at the expense of our intellect and to the profit of the person posting.

We live in a world where we have the potential of being the most informed people in our brief history in this universe, but we are plagued by some people trying to turn a quick buck or influence the masses by posing as an expert or "breaking news". Click bait news stories are on there to get their audience riled up and on the warpath while algorithms process the type of data that the user will see. I know in my news feeds, the adverts and recommended postings are based on my click and search history which is vastly different then that of my wife, my parents, or even my best friends. Our opinions are so different in some cases that we would be shown articles for recommendation that the other would never see. This doesn't help us create diverse and unbiased opinions of our world view, but cements the biased opinions that we already have and makes us less likely to see the whole truth of the matter.

Don't read my blog because I'm an "expert" or something. Read it and then validate what I write on your own. Jump into a discussion with your view and debate the subject matter at hand and see if you are able to persuade or be persuaded. Be informed, and validate your sources.

2017 comes to us with hope. Hope of a new year, that things will go well, that our idols will stop passing away well before their time, that the world finds some kind of peace, and we start loving ourselves as well as our neighbors. But that hope is based on what you do with your year. There will be darkness and hard fought truths coming the next year, but together we can push through for the better of everyone.
