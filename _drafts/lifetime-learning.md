I was listening to the [Developer Tea Podcast](https://spec.fm/podcasts/developer-tea) this morning and he was talking about being a lifelong learning. This comment really struck a chord with me as I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner, or as my wife puts it Hobby ADD because every week it seems to be something new. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

I believe that we should all be constantly learning and pushing ourselves to do more. Really get outside of our comfort zone our push ourselves outside of our daily routine. Right now, I am a "Cloud Engineer". What that really means is I manage our internal data center that customers can use as if it was there own data center. It's their cloud, my computer. But I didn't just know about all the technologies that are inside this data center, I had to put the time in and learn it all. VMware, Cisco, NetApp, Windows, and Linux are all technologies that I spent hours of my own time in the evenings or on the weekends trying to wrap my brain around. The same thing with these new things that I am learning like Chef and trying to understand DevOps.
