Some people thing it is what you know and what you done that makes you a strong asset. But I think, it's what you can learn and your ability to adapt and understand new information and technology that really makes a strong engineer. I've heard a few people make the same sentiment when talking about being a lifetime learner. Does this mean everything you have done in life is not worth the time and sweat and (in some cases) blood that you have put into your job? Of course not! What you have done has really helped shape you as a person and an engineer. What we have done before really propels us through our careers and allows us to learn and gives us a sense of direction. I will use myself as an example. If you have ready my [Impostor Syndrome]("https://jessecanderson.github.io/code/2016/11/07/impostor-syndrome.html") post then you have an idea of how my career has gone and where I come from. I've looked at my career and seen how I have jumped from one technology to another technology, always looking for something to learn and understand. This has given me the opportunity to touch pretty much everything in the data center. This has really helped mold me into someone who knows enough about every aspect of the data center to really be able to take on this new DevOps culture and understand the Ops side of things. And my drive to learn more development has helped me see the other hand of DevOps and my ability to think on my feet and understand these technologies really makes me more marketable.
