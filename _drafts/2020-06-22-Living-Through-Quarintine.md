## WWDC 2020

Today was the start of WWDC 2020 and boy was it exciting. With all that is going on in the world right now, I was so looking forward to this confrence. This was going to be an event that would allow us to step away from our day to day and look at what Apple has been keeping secret in their labratory.

And to say they didn't disapoint, for me, is an understatement.

### iOS Updates

Let us start with iOS. The new release is iOS 14, and comes with a number of enhancments and upgrades.

I think the one I am most excited about is the updates to Messages. There are so many nice features added to this app, pin conversations, @mentions, threads inside conversations!! All of these I am really looking foward to trying and being able to utilize.

The second thing I'm excited about is the updates to the Home Screen. This would allow users to drop in widgets into their Home Screen as well as hide pages full of apps they don't want to show! This will help clean up navigation for the users and remove apps that you want to have working on your phone without deleting them.

Why is this important? Well, there are a number of applications that we use daily that tie into our favorite applications like Home, Activity (now fitness), and other applications that that will funnel data to a single point. Being able to move these applications to their own pages and then able to hide that application or applications from their everyday usage. But the app will still be there to do it's data thing and whateve the user wants/needs of it. I think this will be really nice and allow people to customize their homescreens in a way they couldn't before.

Widgets!! OMG, I'm so happy that Apple has finally made these useful. I loved the idea of widgets when they were on the Mac and in the early part of iOS. But, I never really used them much. They were shuffled off to their own page and all that information that I could have had access to just sat there....out of site and out of mind. But now, we can embed widgets into our home screens and this makes me happy. They maybe useful again! Here is hoping for some cool rich widgets that we can actually use.

## iPadOS Updates

I know there were some cool things to iPadOS, but I didn't get much into that one. As a developer, it is super important to know how best to integrate into all the platforms that you develop for but I watched this as a customer and I don't use my iPad right now. I have one, that just sits there. It's a solid device, but I have so many other devices that I work on I have trouble reaching for that thing when my laptops or phone are right there. So ya, that's iPadOS for me. ROFL.

## macOS

Craig made a good joke during this part. When he talked about people copying the marketing deparment and how they go on caffine fueled road trips. That made me laugh pretty hard. The new name is Big Sur.

This also had some exciting updates, but it was mostly to bring it in line with iOS and that design language. This unifies so much across all platforms, we now magically have a single OS platform it seems. It's not macOS on all devices and the devices are a bit fragmented with watchOS, tvOS, macOS, iOS, and iPadOS but all are built on the same underlying tech and this gives us a chance to build applications that will run on anything we can design the UI for. And that really exites me.

## Mac

This was the big "One more thing..." moment for Apple this year. Apple is going to start releasing Mac devices running their own silicon.
