After playing with this over the last few days, I really like the setup that I have found. This amazing {personal} theme I found really hits what I want in my layout. I'm not a great developer (working on that) so building my own blog platform wasn't something I wanted to try and tackle when there were so many other options out there. This platform really works for what I want to do.

So here is the deal, I work in infrastructure. I touch a LOT of different technologies and am able to implement solutions for customers that really make a difference. I've been digging into infrastructure as code and configuration management solutions over the last year and have now found myself head down in Chef. I want to post things on Chef, NetApp, Cisco, Puppet, and whatever else I want to touch on. This will be my new home for all of this as well as whatever else I feel like posting.

I have a couple of posts that I'm working on. I owe one for NetApp Insight that happened last month and I'm working on a DevOps focused one. I have a "Chef on Raspberry Pi" post that I want to do documenting the pains I had getting Ruby updated on my Pi and getting that thing bootstrapped. All of this is coming.

Let me know what you think of my new blog home. I'm going to be growing it over the next year with iOS, Chef, NetApp, and Cisco stuffs. I'm also going to be showing my GitHub repositories some much needed love. Hoping I can come up with something useful.
