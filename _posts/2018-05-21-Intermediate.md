As many of you know, I've been going through Treehouse in the Techdegree program to learn iOS development. I've been trying to "become" an iOS or mobile developer for a number of years and have put a LOT of time and effort into learning Swift and how to develop apps for the Apple ecosystem.

Recently, I was able to successfully pass project #3. I am very excited and proud of the progress I have made in the program and I feel this is a good step in rebuilding myself after the events of the last month. My self confidence in all of this was going up!

And then, I realized the next grouping of information was titled <b><u>"Intermediate Swift"</u></b>!

<b>Really?</b>

I'm still trying to wrap my head around this. There is no way that I should be intermediate anything right? On one hand, I feel very confident that the knowledge I have and understanding I have can get me through these next sections and really push me into this next level. The projects are getting harder for sure, but no less fun and interesting. On the other hand, I'm 100% freaking myself out. There is no way I could be even at this level.

I am trying to remain calm, and look at this objectively. Yes, I am smart enough to be here at this level. And yes, I have total control over this and can apply what I have learned so far to this next part of the course. I'm only into project #4 out of 12 projects, so I have tons more to learn and get through. I'm super excited about these projects and what I am going to learn. I need to stay focused on that, and all of this will be ok.

Thank you for participating in my mini-freak-out. You can return to your regular blog now.

P.S. I will have regular blog posts coming soon. I've been writing out topics and trying to plan for content. I'm also thinking of pushing this to a Podcast format and having both written and audio for my content.
