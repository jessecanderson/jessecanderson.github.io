## About

Hello and wecome!

My name is Jesse Anderson and I talk about things. What things you may ask? I talk about all sorts of tech and code things.

I'm a life long learner, and I want to share my learning to help other people learn. Either from my mistakes, or from my accomplishments.
(Usually more mistakes than accomplishments)

I hope you will check back and see what I'm working on, and I really hope that you are able to find something useful here. Thanks for checking it out!
